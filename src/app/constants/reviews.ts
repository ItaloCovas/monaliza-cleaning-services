      "We just moved to CT, and we were used to a person that we had for 10 years. We were not sure what we were going to find here. Well, we didn't get dispainted. Monaliza is very professional, friendly, and kind. The first time she came to the house, she did a through cleaning. We were so happy that now she comes on a monthly basis."
